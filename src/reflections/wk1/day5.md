# This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

This week I learned a lot about bootstrap and display-flex. I have reviewed the different properties a lot that can help me organize things on my page; however, it seems like when I try to apply them I have been getting a lot of unintended results. I think I was feeling overwhelmed with a lot of things at the start of the week. Even just linking bootstrap into my projects and I think I have started to find success with that. I think I understand using containers, rows, and columns a lot more for organizing my web page, it seems I have been struggling most with the functions used to move things. I am still feeling a little overwhelmed with when to use padding vs. margins.
