# What is Git and what is it used for?
Git is used to track and save changes that are made to your work. 
You can save as you add things to your code. 
This makes it easier to go back to previous versions of your files and find and fix errors. 
Git also allows you to collaborate easier with others. 

# What are the benefits of having multiple branches?
Multiple branches make it easier to revert speciic parts of your files alone.
This allows you to change specific things without having to start over on files that are correct and complete.
This makes debugging easier. 

# What is the difference between Git and Github?
Git locally allows you to track and save changes to your files. 
Github is an online platform that allows you to track and save changes to your files online. 
Github allows you to have external copies of your files with changes so if something happens to
your computer, your files are not lost.
