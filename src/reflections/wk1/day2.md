# What is a pseudo class and which ones do you think you will use?
A pseudo class is a keyword added to a selector that specifies a special state of the element.
I think I will commonly use enabled, disabled, hover, and checked. 

# What is specify and how is it used?
Specificity determines what action happens when more than one could based on the situation. You use it to define which action should happen based on giving different commands values. The higher the specificity, that will be the action that happens. 

# What problems can occur with overuse of the !important feature?
The !important feature makes whatever you are adding it to have the highest specificity. 
You could run into the problem of adding it and then not understanding what else will be affected by doing so.
