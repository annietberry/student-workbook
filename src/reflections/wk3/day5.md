# This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

This week I feel like I am finally getting more comfortable with bootstrap and the mvc model. I am feeling a lot better linking everything up. I understand constructors a lot better as well. One part of the mvc model that I still struggle with is understanding the template and remembering to make it match the html exactly. Another issue that I ran into was forgetting to add parameters to a onclick function within my html where I did so in my template. Overall, the mvc model is making more sense, however; sometimes I struggle to understand where functions should be written and why.
