Encapsulation determines who can access & modify data. It helps protect users from being able to accidentally or maliciously alter and access data. 

# What were some of the problems with closures and the underscore prefix?
The problem with the underscore prefix is that it is signifying it is intended to be private; however, that does not mean that it is put into a part of the code where it is actually private. 

# How do we create private variables in a ES6 Class? Why would you do this?
Every variable in an ES6 class is private by default. They are made accessible by using the export function. You would do this to make sure that everything is protected and inaccessible except for what you specifically want to be accessible.
