# What problem does using exports solve?
Exports make code from modules accessible to other parts of our code. 

# How does export differ from export default?
Export default allows you to only export modules you want to use in other parts of your code, its not mandatory for you to export every module in the script. Using export it is mandatory for you to export every module in the script.

# What is a benefit of using the Module System?
The system helps you write code in your module and expose only those parts of the code that should be accessed by other parts of your code. Code can be broken into smaller sections based on self contained functionality, therefore allowing you to debug easier, and be better organized.
