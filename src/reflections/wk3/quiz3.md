# Application Architecture, MVC Design Pattern

**1.** What are the Pillars of Object Oriented Programming (`OOP`)?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
  Encapsulation: The bundling of data and the methods that act on that data such that access to that data is       restricted from outside the bundle. This means that an object stores its state privately, and only the object’s
  methods have access to change it
  Abstration: Abstraction is an extension of encapsulation. It is the process of selecting data from a larger pool to show only the relevant details to the object.
  Inheritance: Inheritance is the ability of one object to acquire some/all properties of another object.
  Polymorphism: Polymorphism gives us a way to use a class exactly like its parent so there is no confusion with mixing types.

```
**2.** How would you access the `name` of the below object using the `property` variable?
```js
let staff = {
  name: "Tim",
  age: 26,
  job: "Code Monkey"
  }
let property = 'name'

**4.** What does the S stand for in the `SOLID` principles?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```Single Responsibility: a class should only have one responsibility

```
**5.** What the difference between a `class` and an instance of a `class`?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```The class is the definition of what the thing is. An instance is some piece of data created by the constructor. 

```
**6.** What is a `Proxy` object?

**7.** What is the purpose of the `MVC` pattern?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
The MVC (Model-View-Controller) is an architectural pattern that separates an application into three main logical components: the model, the view, and the controller. This is done to separate internal representations of information from the ways information is presented to and accepted from the user
