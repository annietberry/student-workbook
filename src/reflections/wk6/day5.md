# This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

This week I learned more about SPA's. I feel like I am struggling quite a bit still with this stuff. I am having issues with auth0 still. I also have been having some issues with understanding what components I need to make. It is going alright in terms of recognizing what I want to display to the screen and being able to only load a certain number of things with buttons to move between pages. Bootstrap is similarly getting a bit easier to use.
