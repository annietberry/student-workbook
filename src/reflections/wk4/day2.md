# What are the three states of a Promise?
-fulfilled, rejected, and pending

# How do promises seek to resolve the issues of "callback hell"?
Promises are a way to write async code that still appears as though it is executing in a top-down way, and handles more types of errors due to encouraged use of try/catch style error handling.

# What is the difference between .then() and .catch()?
if a promise is a resvoled then runs and something happens. otherwise an error is caught.
