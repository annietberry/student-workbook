# What does REST stand for, and in simple terms what does it mean?
REST is an architectural style, or design pattern, for APIs. EST stands for REpresentational State Transfer.

It means when a RESTful API is called, the server will transfer to the client a representation of the state of the requested resource.
# What does Stateless mean?
Stateless means the server does not remember anything about the user who uses the API. It doesn't remember if the user of the API already sent a GET request for the same resource in the past, it doesn't remember which resources the user of the API requested before, and so on.

# What URL pattern is used when writing a RESTful API?
An identifier for the resource you are interested in. This is the URL for the resource, also known as the endpoint. In fact, URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator.
