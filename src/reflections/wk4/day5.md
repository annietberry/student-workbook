# This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

This week it seems like I kept getting more familiar with using the MVC model. I had an interesting time learning how to use axios. I was able to access the information pretty easily, but ran into a few weird issues where I was saving multiple copies of the same thing to my sandbox on accident. I feel like its starting to make more sense though. Overall, I am feeling like I am enjoying whwen I get stuck in code. I feel like I am not making as many of the same mistakes over and over.
