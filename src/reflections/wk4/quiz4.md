# UnderStanding Asynchronous Code, and API's

**1.** What is the difference between `asynchronous` code and `synchronous` code?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
In synchronous code every line of code runs after one another. In asynchronous code when await is called the code has to stop running until the previous code of line is finished running. 
```
**2.** What is an event listener?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
An event listener is a procedure in JavaScript that waits for an event to occur.
```
**3.** What does the `O` represent in the `SOLID` principles?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
Open closed principles.
```
**4.** What is a callback / higher order function?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
It is a function that is passed to another function, and the callback function is called (or executed) inside it. 
```
**5.** What is a `promise`? How do you capture an error from a `promise`?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
it is a guarantee that we are going to do something in the future. You capture an error from a promise with a catch. 
```
**6.** Name three processes used to make requests over `HTTP`?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
The request to the server has to include a resource identifier
The response the server returns include enough information so the client can modify the resource
Each request to the API contains all the information the server needs to perform the request, and each response the server returns contain all the information the client needs in order to understand the response.

```
**7.** What does the `API` acronym stand for?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
application programming interface. 
```
**8.** In the `MVC` design pattern, who is responsible for making calls to `APIs`?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
The controller. 
```
**9.** What is the purpose of encapsulation in programming?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
Encapsulation is the bundling of data and the methods that act on the data so access to the data is restricted from outside. Objects store its state privately and you can only access it with the objects methods. Encapsulation helps you project your data. 
```
**10.** What is `HTTP` response code for a successful request?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
200
```
**11.** What is a 500 error?
