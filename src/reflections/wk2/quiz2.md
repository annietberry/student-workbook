**4.** Given this array: 
```js
let fruit = ['apple', 'banana', 'pineapple',  'orange', 'strawberry']
``` 
What index is the pineapple's current position? How do you know?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```2. You know this because the first thing in an array always starts at 0 increases by 1 as you move left to right.

```
**5.** With these two objects: 
```js

```
**7.** In the `for loop` below, what is the name of the piece belongs inside the empty "______" space? What would you put here to increase `i` by one on every iteration?
```js
for ( let i = 0; i < arr.length; _______ ) {
  //...
```
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```The final-expression. You would put i++ to increase i by one on every iteration.
