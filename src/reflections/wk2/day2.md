# What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts (if any)?
function declaration: can be used before it's defined
function expression: cannot be used before it is defined
arrow function expression: do not create their own this value

# What is the difference between Parameters and Arguments?
Parameters are used when defining a function whereas arguments are passed in when invoking the function. 
# What are higher order functions? Can you provide an example? 
higher order functions are funcions that operate on other functions, either as an argument or return. An example of this would be function greeting(hello())
