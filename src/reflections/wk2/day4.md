# What are the benefits of making a plan before starting to just write the code?
You can write out what methods are going to have to call what methods. This helps so you aren't having to track down the bouncing ball later to see when differen't methods are calling each other. 
# How do you find answers when you are stuck?
Google has become my friend. I read through a lot of documentation and have been adding in console logs, alerts, and been using my debugger tool. I also try to write out what methods are calling each other and when to track how my code is running. 

# From the entire article what are your biggest takeaways? 
That you need to have a gameplan before you begin trying to code.
