# What is Scope ?
Scope means where you are able to access variables for use. For example, using var declared outside of a function, you may use this within the function as well. If you use var within a function, you are not able to access and use it outside of the function. 
 
# What is Hoisting ?
Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism that recognizes variables and function declarations before the code runs. It rearranges variable declarations to be recognized before running functions. 

# In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?
let: when you won't redeclare within the scope
const: when the value won't change
var: when you want to redeclare
