# This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.
I am feeling quite a bit better with this week of the course. I enjoy javaScript more than HTML & CSS. I enjoyed learning about declarations of variables and where you should declare them for use in different parts of your code. I also enjoyed learning about methods and how you have to think through where you are going to have to call them so you have everything laid out what you need to do before you begin coding. I learned that if you add in a return to an if conditional then you don't have to write out else or else if statements. I am feeling quite a bit better with bootstrap at this point as well. I added a live server extension to vs code that helps me visualize what exactly happens when you add in different padding, margins, and flex properties.
