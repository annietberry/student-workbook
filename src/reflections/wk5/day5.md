# This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

This week was interesting with the hackathon. I enjoyed working on all of the backend stuff for our reddit like project. I am still struggling with front end stuff however. I enjoyed learning from watching others work on it. It is interesting to me how you need to think about the best places to put modules for instance so that they behave how you expect them to. The other interesting thing about the hackathon was seeing peoples preference when writing code, i.e. where people decide to put templates. I am enjoying the struggle a lot more this week.
