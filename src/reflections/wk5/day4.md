# What is a virtual property?
 a property whose behavior can be overridden within an inheriting class

# When might you use a virtual property?
So you don't have to rewrite code that needs to be reused between different classes. 

# How do you search by a virtual properties value?
Use  $where or $expr, which allow you to manually "compute" a virtual property and create a more customised query.
